# Python-challanege-Lishi

Hi, 

I have some experience of R and Python, so I just use Pycharm instead of Conda for this assignment. 

Scripts for Pybank and PyPoll were in two main.py files, and there are also two result files in the Analysis folder.

I am using Pandas for Pypoll and the basic function in Pybank. 

cheers
Lishi
